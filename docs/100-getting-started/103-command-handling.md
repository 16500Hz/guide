# Command handling

Unless your bot project is a small one, it's a good idea to organize your bot's collection of commands and listeners into separate classes. [**Cogs**]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/cogs.html) help you to do just that!

Note that cogs are typically used alongside with [**Extensions**]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/extensions.html).
