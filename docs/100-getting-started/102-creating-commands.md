# Creating commands

!!! Note

    This page is a follow-up, and the base code used is from the previous page ([Initial files](./101-initial-files.md)). The code can be found on the GitHub repository [here]({{ guiderepo }}/tree/main/docs/extra-code-samples/intial-files).

The most basic commands that can be defined for a Discord bot are message commands. Discord also allows developers to register [slash commands][devdocs-slash-cmds], which provides users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application. These slash commands shall be covered by the guide [here](../200-interactions/202-slash-commands.md), in the **Interactions** section.
