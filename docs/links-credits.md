# Links and credits

This guide is made using [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator geared towards building project
documentation. The theme used specifically for the guide is squidfunk's
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

The idea of building a guide that showcases the use of `disnake`'s syntax was inpired from
[**Discord.js**](https://discord.js.org/), one of the most popular JavaScript Discord libraries; their guide can be
found [here](https://discordjs.guide/). The credit for the initial directory structure and articles, goes to them.

Since this project started as members-only, the credits for a majority of the initial content go to our organization
members - **thesadru**, **shiftinv**, **Victorsitou**, **vcokltfre**, **m1raynee** and **AbhigyanTrips**. We also thank
to all contributors on the repository, who strive to make the guide better.

Lastly, a huge thanks to **you**, the members of the `disnake` community, for supporting our library and choosing us for
your bot development journey. We as the authors of this guide aim to familiarize users on coding Discord bots with our
library, and your support gives us a boost to make the guide better, one commit at a time.
