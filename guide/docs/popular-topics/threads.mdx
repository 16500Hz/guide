# Threads

Threads are <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.Messageable">Messageable</DocsLink> objects, and can be thought of as
sub-channels inside existing channels. They allow organization of multiple topics in a channel by temporarily giving
them a separate space.

## Thread-related methods

#### Creating and deleting threads

A thread can be created by using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel.create_thread">create_thread()</DocsLink>
method on a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message">Message</DocsLink> or

<DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel">TextChannel</DocsLink> object.

```python title="threads.py"
# Using the 'Message' object.
message = bot.fetch_message(1234567890)
await message.create_thread(
    name="This message will act as the thread's starting message.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
)

# Using the 'TextChannel' object.
channel = bot.get_channel(...)
await channel.create_thread(
    name="This thread requires a starting message to be specified.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
    message=message,
)
```

#### Joining and leaving threads

#### Archiving, unarchiving and locking threads

#### Public and private threads

#### Adding and removing members
