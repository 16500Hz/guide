# Slash Commands

A **slash command** is one of the types of client-integrated interactions a bot can create. Unlike prefix commands, these do not require the message intent.

This section will go in-depth on the creation, types and handling of slash commands with `disnake`.

:::note

A bot needs to be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope in order to create slash commands in a guild.

:::

To create a slash command, you need to use the `@bot.slash_command` decorator.

```python 
@bot.slash_command(
	name="ping",
	description="Returns websocket latency.",
)
async def ping(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
	...
```

				ping
			</DiscordInteraction>
		</div>
		Pong!

## Registering commands

### Global commands

### Guild commands

## Responding to commands

### Sending responses

<DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.response">response</DocsLink> attribute returns a <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse">
	InteractionResponse
</DocsLink> instance that has 4 usable methods. A response can <b>only be done once</b>. If you want to send secondary
messages, consider using a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.followup">followup</DocsLink> webhook instead.

<br />
<br />

1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message">send_message</DocsLink> - Sends response message
2. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message">edit_message</DocsLink> - Edits original message, you're
   unable to use this in application command because there are no message while you responding
3. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> - Defers the interaction
4. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.is_done">is_done</DocsLink> - Indicates whether an interaction response
   has been done before

:::note

<DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> works differently depending on the type of interaction.
It creates "Bot is thinking..." message for application commands and doesn't throw "This interaction failed" if you're not
going to respond to message components.

:::

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) while responding, you must first defer the interaction. Then
when your response is ready you can edit the message using <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_original_message">edit_original_message</DocsLink> method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message("The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### Follow-ups

Often used when you need to send secondary messages after responding.
