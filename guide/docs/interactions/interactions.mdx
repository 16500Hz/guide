# What are interactions?

An **Interaction** is the message that your bot receives when a user initiates an application command or a message
component.

## Interactions and Bot Users

We're all used to the way that Discord bots have worked for a long time. You make an application in
[Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), make a new bot user, and copy the token. Interactions
bring something entirely new - the ability to interact with an application _without needing a bot user in the guild_.
Responding to the interaction doesn't require a bot token.

`disnake` is primarily focused on using the gateway events, so you still need a bot user. Check out
[`hikari-py`](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) with their REST-API part for this purpose.

Welcome to the new world.

## Responding to interactions

You have only 3 seconds to respond to the interaction. If do not have time to do it, Discord will shown "This
interaction failed" error.

In fact, there are 3 types of interactions:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction" /> (for <a href="/interactions/application-commands">
    	application commands
    </a>
    )
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.MessageInteraction" /> (for <a href="/interactions/message-components">
    	message components
    </a>
    )
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction" /> (a base class, usually not used)

But responding is the same for both interactions types.

### `interaction.response`

<DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.response">response</DocsLink> attribute returns a <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse">
	InteractionResponse
</DocsLink> instance that has 4 usable methods. A response can <b>only be done once</b>. If you want to send secondary
messages, consider using a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.followup">followup</DocsLink> webhook instead.

1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message">send_message</DocsLink> - Sends response message
2. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message">edit_message</DocsLink> - Edits original message, you're
   unable to use this in application command because there are no message while you responding
3. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> - Defers the interaction
4. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.is_done">is_done</DocsLink> - Indicates whether an interaction response
   has been done before

:::note

<DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> works differently depending on the type of interaction.
It creates "Bot is thinking..." message for application commands and doesn't throw "This interaction failed" if you're not
going to respond to message components.

:::

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) while responding, you must first defer the interaction. Then
when your response is ready you can edit the message using

<DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_original_message">edit_original_message</DocsLink> method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message("The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### `interaction.followup`

Often used when you need to send secondary messages after responding.
